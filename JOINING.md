# Joining OCACI

> 🚧 **Working Draft** — This is a community-driven effort, currently in its initial setup and planning phase. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

Thank you for your interest in joining the Open Collective of AWS Certified Independents (OCACI)!

To join our directory as an official **OCACI Member**, you'll need to submit your profile:

1. Create a new Markdown file under `content/consultants/` using a slug derived from your name (e.g., `john-doe.md`).
2. Add only the following front-matter at the top of the file:

    ```yaml
    ---
    name: Your Name
    iqProfile: https://iq.aws.amazon.com/e/your-expert-id
    github: your-github-username
    ---
    ```

3. In your Pull Request description, explicitly agree to our [Governance](GOVERNANCE.md) and [Community Principles](README.md).
For example:
     ```
     I agree to follow the project's governance and community principles.
     ```

**Review process:**
- Maintainers will run script to fetch and populate additional profile fields (certifications, bio, ratings, etc.).
- They will verify that the `github` front-matter matches the PR author's GitHub handle.

Once approved, you'll be invited to the GitHub organization and your profile will go live on the site.
