# OCACI – Open Collective of AWS Certified Independents

> 🚧 **Working Draft** — This is a community-driven effort, currently in its initial setup and planning phase. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

**Open Collective of AWS Certified Independents (OCACI)** is a community-owned, open directory of independent AWS-certified consultants — starting with AWS IQ Experts.
We exist to provide a transparent, trusted resource connecting certified independents with customers seeking AWS expertise.

## ✨ Mission

Our mission is to:

- Connect independent AWS-certified consultants with customers
- Foster open collaboration and knowledge-sharing among independent professionals
- Operate transparently under community governance
- Build practical, open-source solutions benefiting AWS independents and their clients

## 🛠️ What We're Building

Initially, we'll create:

- A public directory of AWS-certified independents active on AWS IQ. Future direct-enrollment criteria will be decided by the community once AWS IQ winds down.
- A simple GitHub Pages-powered website built with Hugo
- Clear governance and community guidelines
- Easy, GitHub-based workflows for adding and updating consultant profiles
- A platform to highlight and share knowledge (e.g., blog posts, articles, toolsets)

## 📌 Current Project Status
