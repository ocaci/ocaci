- comment: Working with Rutka was phenomenal. He lowered our monthly costs from $220
    to around $3. That's amazing! He had to go deep to find the problem, which had
    to do with a revisioning setting and created a rule which fixed everything. We
    knew something was very wrong but didn't have the knowledge to fix it. Rutka did.
    He was also clear in his communication and easy to work with.

    SES email inbound and outbound deliverability issues, and I couldn't be more impressed.
    Michal's expertise in AWS was evident from the start. He not only solved the problem
    efficiently but also provided a wealth of free advice, demonstrating incredible
