title: "Join OCACI"
---

As you know, AWS IQ is [shutting down](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-iq/latest/experts-user-guide/aws-iq-end-of-support.html). OCACI (our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/ocaci)) is the new home for AWS-certified independent consultants.

**Eligibility:** OCACI is open only to individual independent consultants. Resellers, agencies, or consulting firms are not eligible to join.

Our mission is to build a community-driven directory that helps customers find and hire independent consultants like you.

To become an **OCACI Member**, follow these steps:

1. Open a new GitHub issue using our **Join OCACI** template:
   {{< external href="https://github.com/ocaci/ocaci/issues/new?template=join-ocaci-iq.yml" rel="noopener" >}}Create Join Request{{< /external >}}.
2. Provide your **AWS IQ Profile ID**.
3. Confirm you agree to our [Governance](https://github.com/ocaci/ocaci/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) and [Community Principles](https://github.com/ocaci/ocaci/blob/main/README.md).
4. Submit the issue. Maintainers will review your request, invite you to the GitHub organization, and add your profile to the directory.

We look forward to welcoming you to OCACI!
