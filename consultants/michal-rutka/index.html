<time datetime=2025-03-18T19:16:46.174Z>March 18, 2025</time></div><p class=review-comment>Working with Rutka was phenomenal. He lowered our monthly costs from $220 to around $3. That's amazing! He had to go deep to find the problem, which had to do with a revisioning setting and created a rule which fixed everything. We knew something was very wrong but didn't have the knowledge to fix it. Rutka did. He was also clear in his communication and easy to work with.</p></div><div class=review-card><div class=review-header><span class=stars style=--rating:5></span>
<time datetime=2024-08-20T16:37:26.286Z>August 20, 2024</time></div><p class=review-comment>I had the pleasure of working with Michal on resolving a challenging AWS SES email inbound and outbound deliverability issues, and I couldn't be more impressed. Michal's expertise in AWS was evident from the start. He not only solved the problem efficiently but also provided a wealth of free advice, demonstrating incredible patience and professionalism throughout the process. His deep experience and thoughtful guidance made a significant difference. Highly recommended!</p></div></div></section></article></main></div><footer><p>¬© 2025 Open Collective of AWS Certified Independents</p></footer></body></html>
